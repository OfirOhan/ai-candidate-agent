"""
Refusal Evaluator — evaluates whether the agent correctly refuses inappropriate
questions AND correctly answers legitimate ones.

Runs on ALL questions to produce a confusion matrix:
  - TP: negative question → agent refused ✅
  - TN: real question → agent answered ✅
  - FP: real question → agent refused ❌ (false refusal)
  - FN: negative question → agent answered ❌ (missed refusal)

Additional metrics:
  - Hallucination: Did the agent fabricate answers to negative questions?
  - Professional Redirect: Does the refusal redirect to professional information?
