README = """# Real-Time Event Enrichment Pipeline
High-throughput streaming pipeline for mobile attribution event enrichment.
## Overview
Processes 1.2M events/second for real-time mobile attribution enrichment at AppsFlyer. Ingests raw attribution events, enriches with device/geo/campaign metadata, applies fraud detection rules, and routes to analytics and reporting systems.
## Architecture
Three-stage pipeline: Kafka ingestion layer with 500+ partitions, Flink stateful processing with RocksDB state backend for sessionization and deduplication, and ClickHouse sink for real-time OLAP queries. Multi-region deployment with Kafka MirrorMaker 2 for cross-region replication.
## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java 17, Kotlin
- **Streaming:** Apache Kafka, Apache Flink
- **Storage:** ClickHouse, Redis, S3
- **Infrastructure:** Kubernetes (EKS), Terraform
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog
- **Serialization:** Protocol Buffers, Avro
## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/talbendavid/event-enrichment
cd event-enrichment
./gradlew build
helm install pipeline ./charts/pipeline
```
## Key Features
- 1.2M events/second throughput with sub-100ms end-to-end latency
- Exactly-once processing semantics with Kafka transactions
- Stateful sessionization with 24-hour windows
- Real-time fraud detection with rule engine
- Auto-scaling based on consumer lag metrics
- Multi-region active-active deployment
## Performance
Sustained throughput of 1.2M events/second. P99 end-to-end latency under 100ms. Handles 100B+ daily events across all pipelines. Zero data loss during region failovers.

REC = """# Letter of Recommendation — Tal Ben-David
**From:** Reshef Mann, CTO at AppsFlyer
**Date:** May 22, 2026

To Whom It May Concern,

I recommend Tal Ben-David, who has been a technical cornerstone at AppsFlyer for over six years. Tal joined as a backend engineer and quickly became one of our most influential architects.

Tal's flagship achievement is the real-time event enrichment pipeline processing 1.2M events/second — the backbone of our attribution platform. He designed the architecture from scratch, solving complex challenges around exactly-once semantics, stateful processing, and multi-region consistency.

His leadership of the microservices migration — decomposing our monolith into 40+ services — transformed our engineering velocity, reducing deployment cycles from 2 weeks to 2 hours. As architecture guild leader, Tal mentors 8 senior engineers and has established design review processes that elevated our system quality.

Tal combines rare depth in distributed systems theory (MSc thesis on consensus protocols, published at SOSP Workshop) with pragmatic engineering excellence. His KafkaFlow open-source project (250+ stars) demonstrates his commitment to the broader engineering community.

I recommend Tal without reservation for a Principal Engineer role.

Sincerely,

**Reshef Mann**
CTO, AppsFlyer
