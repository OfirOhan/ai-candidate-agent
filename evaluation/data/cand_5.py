REC="""# Letter of Recommendation — Noa Friedman

**From:** Oren Kaniel, VP of Product at Unity Technologies
**Date:** May 18, 2026

---

To Whom It May Concern,

I am delighted to recommend Noa Friedman, who has been an exceptional product leader in our monetization organization at Unity for over three years. Noa joined from ironSource (pre-acquisition) and seamlessly transitioned into a senior leadership role.

Noa's most transformative contribution has been leading the ML-powered ad mediation product, which increased publisher revenue by 22%. She demonstrated rare ability to bridge product vision with ML engineering, defining clear success metrics and collaborating deeply on model evaluation. This feature impacts 1.5B monthly end-users, underscoring the scale of her responsibilities.

Her work on the real-time analytics dashboard has been equally impactful, giving 50K+ game developers unprecedented visibility into their monetization performance. Noa drove this initiative from concept through launch, managing cross-functional stakeholders across engineering, design, data science, and sales.

At ironSource, Noa redesigned the SDK integration experience, reducing setup time from 5 days to 2 hours — a change that drove 40% increase in developer adoption. Her customer empathy, honed through 200+ developer interviews, consistently informs her product decisions.

Noa is an outstanding people manager. She leads a team of 3 PMs with clarity, empathy, and high standards. She established our experimentation culture, running 100+ A/B tests per quarter with rigorous statistical methodology.

I wholeheartedly recommend Noa for a Director of Product role. She combines strategic product thinking, data literacy, technical depth, and people leadership in a way that is rare and valuable.

Sincerely,

**Oren Kaniel**
VP of Product
